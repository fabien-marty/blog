# How is this blog operated? And how is it securely hosted for free at Cloudflare?

![](webservers.jpg){align=right : style="width:300px"}

## My requirements for a personal blog

### Markdown

For ages, I've been a big fan of Markdown[^1], like I was a big fan of [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) before.

When I write a document, I want to focus on the content and not on the formatting. I don't want to be disturbed by
the glitches of a WYSIWYG editor and I want to use my favorite tools and not a dedicated UI.

Maybe, it's a kind of personal obsession ðŸ˜… But as it's a personal blog...

### Git!

As Markdown is a text file format, it is "Version Control Friendly".

Here again, what better tool than `Git` to manage versions, backups, synchronize a local draft state
with one published on a remote server!

Since my blog is public (by construction), I can also use a public GitHub repository
to host it for free, with all the advantages that this can bring[^2].

### Automation!

I'm a big fan of automation in general and of CI/CD in particular. I like my work to end with a git push[^3].
Beyond that, I'd rather spend my energy automating things than spending it on repetitive manual tasks.

Not always a time-saver in the short term, but then again, this is a personal blog, so you have to enjoy yourself too!

### Free but solid and fast hosting!

In my professional life, I've worked a lot with web servers and high-traffic hosting. I'm well aware
that this is a difficult art, and that it can be costly in terms of time and money.

What's more, as I now work for a company that specializes in technical SEO, I also know how important delivery performance is.

Finally, this is a personal project, I can't count on a team to update a server or relaunch a service on the weekend or during my vacations, so let's delegate this part to a quality third-party service!

## Overall architecture

![blog-architecture-diagram](blog-architecture.png)

I think that the previous diagram is self-explanatory:

- I mainly use: [`mkdocs-material`](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and a few [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) plugins to generate the static website. So I can preview the result locally and push markdown file changes to GitHub when it's ready.
- After that, everything is automated by GitHub Actions:
  - the website is built and deployed by [`Rclone` diff tool](https://rclone.org/) to [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/developer-platform/r2/) which has a pretty generous free tier.
  -the website is exposed to the world by Cloudflare CDN directly from the R2 bucket.
 
!!! info

    To directly expose a static website hosted in a Cloudflare R2 bucket with Cloudflare CDN you have to add a "transform rule" to deal with `index.html` pages:

    - (incoming request) custom filter expression:
    `ends_with(http.request.uri.path, "/") and (http.host eq "blog.fabien-marty.dev")`
    - (rewrite parameters) dynamic rewrite to:
    `concat(http.request.uri.path, "index.html")`

## Conclusion

I'm pretty happy with these technical choices and this architecture. The workflow is simple and efficient, the website is fast and secure, and the hosting is completely free.
