# Why this blog and what is it about?

## Why?

After more than 20 years of a rich and diversified career in and around 
**Software Engineering** (development, infrastructure, architecture, people and project management with no specific order),
I simply felt the need to share my experience and thoughts on the subject.

<!-- more -->

By writing this, I also hope that taking time to collect my thoughts and write them down made them clearer and more persuasive.
Instead of making the same arguments again and again, often ineffectively.

I see it as a way of structuring my ideas, a bit like a student who summarizes what he's learned in revision sheets.

But let's not overthink it and write it down! We'll see! ðŸš€

## What is it about?

**Software Engineering** of course! 

And as the current title of this blog says, I'm working as a "Staff Software Engineer" now. So I will try to
share my experience and my vision of this job title, which is fairly new in my country (France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·). Maybe I will write
a few articles about that in French.
